**In this project we will build the Model Naive Bayes for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

It is a classification technique based on Bayes‚Äô Theorem with an independence assumption among predictors.
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.<br></br>
The Na√Øve Bayes classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks such as text classification. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of inputs for a given class or category. This approach is based on the assumption that the features of the input data are conditionally independent given the class, allowing the algorithm to make predictions quickly and accurately.<br></br>
In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are considered as simple probabilistic classifiers that apply Bayes‚Äô theorem. This theorem is based on the probability of a hypothesis, given the data and some prior knowledge. The naive Bayes classifier assumes that all features in the input data are independent of each other, which is often not true in real-world scenarios. However, despite this simplifying assumption, the naive Bayes classifier is widely used because of its efficiency and good performance in many real-world applications.



**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
