**In this project we will build the Model Naive Bayes for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an independence assumption among predictors.
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.<br></br>
The Naïve Bayes classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks such as text classification. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of inputs for a given class or category. This approach is based on the assumption that the features of the input data are conditionally independent given the class, allowing the algorithm to make predictions quickly and accurately.


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
